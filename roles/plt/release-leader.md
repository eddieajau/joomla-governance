#Joomla Release Leader
###Roles and Responsibilities

## The Role
The role of the Release Leader is broken down into the following sections. The job description, the reasoning behind the role, the selection process for the role, as well as the benefits of the role to Joomla.

#### Job Description
Joomla will maintain a Release Leader to be in charge of each minor/major release cycle. This will help to facilitate the releases, coordinate efforts, and ensure that each release receives proper focus without overwhelming a single person for multiple releases.

The Release Leader will be the single individual in charge of any final decisions in relation to a particular release series. A release series would be defined as a minor release series (e.g. 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.x) or a major release series (3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.x etc...). 

#### The Reasoning
The reasoning behind this comes as a result of the amount of effort and work that must accompany each release and the strain this effort puts on a single individual. By rotating this responsibility among different individuals Joomla can ensure a single person is not pushed to hard.

#### The Selection Process
The selection of Release Leader will be by a vote of the Production Leadership Team. This will ensure that first of all the individual has been nominated, and/or elected from the community by their peers and also ensure that the PLT as a whole agrees to and supports this individual in any capacity necessary.

#### The Benefits
There are many benefits to this approach. First, a Release Leader will allow for Joomla to keep a fresh and motivated individual in charge of each release. This focused attention will hopefully ensure that merges happen quickly and efficiently; and code is reviewed and commented appropriately. The release leader will serve as an *enabler* in assisting the release process and code committing. Secondly, by focusing a release leader on each release cycle the PLT can essentially focus on multiple release cycles simultaneously. In essence, the 3.3.0 release series and the 3.2.x release series can be focused on by their respective release leaders at the same time and encourage progress to be made on both release series simultaneously.

## The Responsibility
The responsibility of a Release Leader is a large one. They are in charge of overseeing an entire release series. This requires commitment and dedication to the code as well as the ability to interact and communicate effectively with the entire development community. The responsibilities can be broken down into the following sections.

#### The Details
The Release Leader will prepare the release packages for each release in the series, make all final code reviews, coordinate tasks, and communicate concerns with the entire PLT regarding the status of any particular release. The Release Leader is **not** singularly responsible for handling every merge or commit as it relates to the release cycle. Maintainers will still be in charge of merging and committing code, but any conflicts, questions, or problems are handled by the release leader. The release leader is in charge of enabling the maintainers for their release series.

#### The Joomla Community
The Release Leader must be able to determine the needs and interests of the Joomla community and effectively translate them into achievable tasks within a release cycle. They must be capable of listening and outlining both the pros and cons for those tasks. If a task is unattainable based on interest, volunteers, or scope then the release leader must be able to communicate that to the community and clearly define the reasons why.

#### The Development Community
The Release Leader must be able to enable developers by quickly merging properly coded commits, addressing problems in submitted code with grace, and encouraging developers to focus on the tasks as they have been defined. 

#### The Project Manager
The Release Leader must be able to give periodic reports to the Project Manager in regards to progress on the release cycle, and any potential problems which may be presented.

## The Logistics
In order to assist with the onboarding of the next release leader, each release leader will be shadowed by an alternate. This individual will then be able to assume the role of release leader for the next release series. In addition, in the case of emergency or inability of the primary release leader to complete a release series, the alternate will be able to assume that position and fulfill those responsibilities.
