The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## 1. General Provisions

1.1 This by-law only applies where a vote is called within and as it relates to this Github repository. External law and statute may override this by-law.

1.2 Only individual people with a registered account on [github.com](https://github.com) may vote.

1.3 Voting is only valid when conducted in an _Issue_ marked for voting.

1.4 Votes MUST be either `+1` (in favour) or `-1` (against).

1.5 Votes MUST be cast over a **voting period** having a minimum duration of fourteen (14) days unless a longer period is nominated.

1.6 Unless advised otherwise, the timezone for dates and times is assumed to by UTC.

1.7 When a vote is called, the end of the voting period MUST be announced. Unless nominated otherwise, 

1.8 A vote passes if a simple majority of the votes cast in favour and against is exceeded. A vote that draws (same number of vote in favour and against) fails.
