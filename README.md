# Joomla! Governance Repository

An unofficial thought experiment for how the Joomla! project could manage policy, procedure and other things with source control.

## The Idea

### To Centralise Documentation

Joomla information in everywhere except in a central place. Procedure and roles are known from experience and not written down. Surveys are conducted and the results are scattered on personal hard drives or somewhere in the cloud.

The Joomla project would benefit from having all it's most important information and data in a central, well-managed location.

### To Track Change

Not only is it hard to find information, it's even harder to know when information changes.

Storing information in a Version Control System like Github would allow the Joomla project to track when new information was added and when existing information changed.

### To Empower Change

Just as we have information spread across the Joomla landscape, the way official information changes also varies dramatically from team to team.

Managing change through a Version Control System like Github allows everyone to engage in change and feel empowered to effect change and maintain openness and transparency.

## Types of Information

Except where a native data format is more appropriate (like spreadsheets, etc), all information is stored as text files formatted with Markdown syntax.

### Policies

Overarching policies which govern our culture as an Open Source project. Change is made with a high level of community participation and structured process.

### Procedures

Procedures are a record of operational tasks. Change is a managed informally, mostly within the teams that the procedure affects.

### Roles

Roles outline what people or teams do. Change is a managed informally, mostly within the teams that the role affects.

### By-laws

The rules that govern how this repository functions. Change is made with a high level of community participation and structured process..

### Data

The library is a repository of data that has been collected by the project. The data is final and does not change.

## Managing Change

All change would is managed by pull requests in exactly the same way the source code for the Joomla software is managed. Important changes, like changes to policy, would require formal consultation and feedback. Changes to local team information may be handled informally, but still conducted using pull request so that there is always an audit trail.

## Getting Help

It's often hard to find a place to ask for help about matters of policy or procedure. The issue tracker of this repository would serve as a first-level support hub for directing people to the right place to find more information, or even to query how to interpret existing information.
